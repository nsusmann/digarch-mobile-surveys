# digarch-mobile-surveys
This activity shows you how to record locations with Kobo toolbox. The example is using the Jesuit cemetery at the College of the Holy Cross. Before creating the survey form, I recommend working together with your class to decide on what types of information they want to record per grave and then discussing the types of fields that would be appropriate for each.
